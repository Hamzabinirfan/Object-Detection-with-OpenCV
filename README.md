# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
This project is a simple Python script that uses OpenCV to perform real-time object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model. It captures video from a webcam, processes each frame, and displays detected objects along with their class labels and confidence scores.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
A webcam or camera connected to your computer

You can install OpenCV using pip:
# pip install opencv-python

# Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the source code files.
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the script using the following command:

# python objectdetect.py
The webcam feed will open, and you can see the real-time object detection in action.
To exit the application, press the 'h' key.

# COCO
The COCO dataset is publicly available for download from the official COCO website: http://cocodataset.org/.
