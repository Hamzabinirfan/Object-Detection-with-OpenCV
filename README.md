# Object-Detection-with-OpenCV
This project is a simple Python script that uses OpenCV to perform real-time object detection using a pre-trained deep learning model. It captures video from a webcam, processes each frame, and displays detected objects along with their class labels and confidence scores.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
A webcam or camera connected to your computer

You can install OpenCV using pip:
# pip install opencv-python

# Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script using the following command:

# python objectdetect.py

The webcam feed will open, and you can see the real-time object detection in action.

To exit the application, press the 'h' key.



# Configuration
You can change the confidence threshold by modifying the thres variable in the objectdetect.py script. This threshold controls which detected objects are displayed.

You can adjust the frame size by uncommenting and changing the lines that set the frame width and height in the script.

# Model and Class Names
The code uses a pre-trained object detection model and class names from the COCO dataset. The model files and class names are configured in the script using the configPath, weightsPath, and classFile variables.

Make sure you have the correct model and class name files in your project directory. You can replace them with other models and class names as needed.

# Acknowledgments
The code utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision and object detection.

The pre-trained model used in this project is for demonstration purposes. For more advanced applications, you can replace it with more powerful models or fine-tune it for your specific use case.
